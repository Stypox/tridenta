Fixed:
- Fix app crashing at startup due to invalid date format in line news items
- Nicely handle errors while reloading lines and stops by showing an error row, so that next time there is a problem the app will not crash abruptly, allowing users to report the error

Development:
- Target API 36 (Android 16)
- Update various libraries and fix deprecations
