Tridenta loads and shows the <b>local transportation</b> data of the italian region "<i>Trentino</i>". You can view information about <b>stops</b>, <b>lines</b> and most importantly <b>trips</b>, whose <b>delay</b> can be queried in <b>real time</b>! The app also has favorites and history, and allows creating shortcuts in the phone launcher.

<ul>
<li><b>Stops</b>: view and search stops all across Trentino, and see which lines pass by a stop</li>
<li><b>Lines</b>: filter urban and suburban lines by area by choosing from a map of Trentino</li>
<li><b>Trips</b>: view trips performed by a line or passing by a stop at a specific time, with arrival times, delay, headsign and direction information</li>
<li><b>Favorites</b> and history are shown in the drawer for easy access to the lines or stops you use the most</li>
<li><b>Shortcuts</b> in your phone's application launcher can link directly to a specific screen inside Tridenta, allowing you to save even more time</li>
</ul>

Tridenta was built using Jetpack Compose, along with Material 3 design, and supports dark and light themes with dynamic colors (Android 12+ only). The information shown in Tridenta comes from the same APIs that the official "Muoversi in Trentino" app uses.
