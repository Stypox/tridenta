# Privacy policy for Google Play Store

Tridenta connects to the APIs of "[Muoversi in Trentino](https://www.trentinotrasporti.it/en/travel-with-us/muoversi-en)" in order to obtain the data to show inside the app, i.e. lines, stops and trips. The received data might be stored locally for caching purposes. No user information is ever sent to that service (except for what is required to establish network connections, such as the IP), and no other online services are used. Tridenta is not affiliated with "Muoversi in Trentino".

The data Tridenta stores about the user are favorites, history and logs. They are kept in a local and private database which is only used by Tridenta itself to show those specific pieces of information inside the app. Therefore, no personal data ever exits the app by design. Favorites and history are stored forever, while logs are auto-deleted 14 days after they were generated. Logs are used only for debugging and troubleshooting purposes, and do not contain any specific user information.

The user can easily delete all of his personal data by just clearing the app's storage from Android settings, or by uninstalling the app completely.
